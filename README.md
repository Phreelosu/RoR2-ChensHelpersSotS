# Chen's Helpers

## Description

A Risk of Rain 2 mod library of helpers that may aid other mod creators. This is mainly made for my own mods.

The library is **fully documented**.

## How to use

Just download the package from **[Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/Chen/ChensHelpers/)** and add the DLL and XML files as project reference. Move the DLL and XML files accordingly first before adding reference.

Documentation can be found in **[GitHub Pages](https://cheeeeeeeeeen.github.io/RoR2-ChensHelpers/)**.

## Notable Features
- Minion Ownership assignment with synchronization support and queuing system. The helper does it all instead of manually syncing them.
- Different wave functions available, especially the sine wave.
- Assets Manager which registers your custom Unity Asset and WWise sound bundles included in your mod.
- General modding helpers for testing in-game, such as Pickup Droplet Generators and testing of WWise sounds.
- Fetching + Adding Components to Game Objects. Easily fetch or add the component in a single line of code.
- Easily implement Queuing Systems.
- ... and many more. Check the [documentation](https://cheeeeeeeeeen.github.io/RoR2-ChensHelpers/).
